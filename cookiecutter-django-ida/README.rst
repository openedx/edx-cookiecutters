A cookiecutter_ template for edX Django projects.

.. _cookiecutter: https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

**This template produces a Python 3.8 project.**

This cookiecutter template is intended for new edX independently deployable apps (IDAs). It includes the following packages:

* Django 3.2
* Django REST Framework
* Django Waffle

The necessary configuration is also in place to support:

* i18n
* Documentation (using Sphinx_)
* Authentication with OAuth2
* Loading settings from YAML (for production)
* Pylint/Pycodestyle validation
* Github Actions for CI

.. _Sphinx: https://sphinx-doc.org/

Usage
*****


To create a project using this cookiecutter, follow the instructions found in edx-cookiecutter's `readme`_.

.. _readme: https://github.com/openedx/edx-cookiecutters/blob/master/README.rst


After the new folder is created, you will need to:

1. ``cd <new_repo_folder>``
2. Create a python 3 virtual environment and activate it
3. ``make upgrade``
4. ``make docker_build``
5. ``docker-compose up``
6. ``./provision-{project_name}.sh``
7. Commit and push all your changes: ``git commit â€¦`` ``git push``
8. Connect repo to renovate(and other github tools): see `Set up Renovate to Automate JavaScript Dependency Updates`_

.. _Set up Renovate to Automate JavaScript Dependency Updates: https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AC/pages/1841791377/Set+up+Renovate+to+Automate+JavaScript+Dependency+Updates

**Note** This cookiecutter repo currently has some issues with repos that use a hyphen in their name. If this is the case, some pieces of the repo will need to be changed from ``new-repo-name`` to ``new_repo_name``, particularly the Python pieces.

Requirements
============

Once you initialize your project, run ``make upgrade`` to generate
``.txt`` files in the ``requirements/`` directory,
which will contain pinned dependency versions.
Regularly re-run this command going forward in order to freshen the version pins.
Failure to do so could open your IDA to bugs, security vulnerabilities,
and other issues.

It is recommended to follow the instructions in
`Adding repositories for auto python dependency management <https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TE/pages/989135321/Adding+repositories+for+auto+python+dependency+management>`_
in order to perform this process on a regular cadence.

User Model Customization
========================

The project includes a custom Django user model in ``core/models.py``. You must further customize this model as your IDA/service requires. You MUST generate migrations for this model before Django can start:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py makemigrations

Documentation
=============

Sphinx is set up for your project in the ``docs`` directory. All developer documentation should be added here (as opposed to a long README file). Doing this also has the added benefit of giving you a good starting point when the time comes to open source your project!

Sphinx is themed with the Sphinx book theme `sphinx-book-theme <https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme>`_ by default. If you wish to publish your documentation to Read the Docs you will need to make sure to take the steps `outlined here <https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/3723755596/How+to+Add+a+Repo+to+ReadTheDocs>`_.

How To Contribute
*****************

Contributions are welcome. Please read `How To Contribute <https://github.com/openedx/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ for details.

Testing
=======

The ``Makefile`` includes a ``test`` target that runs basic validation on this template. This validation includes::

    * Create a new project using the template.
    * Generate and install pinned requirements
    * Run the project's migrations and validations.
    * Extract and compile translations.
    * Compile documentation.

Run this validation using the command below.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make test
