# Packages installed:

# language-pack-en locales; ubuntu locale support so that system utilities have a consistent
# language and time zone.

# python; ubuntu doesnt ship with python, so this is the python we will use to run the application

# python3-pip; install pip to install application requirements.txt files

# libmysqlclient-dev; to install header files needed to use native C implementation for
# MySQL-python for performance gains.

# libssl-dev; # mysqlclient wont install without this.

# python3-dev; to install header files for python extensions; much wheel-building depends on this

# gcc; for compiling python extensions distributed with python packages like mysql-client

# If you add a package here please include a comment above describing what it is used for
