0001 Purpose of This Repo
=========================

Status
------

**Draft**

.. TODO: When ready, update the status from Draft to Provisional or Accepted.

.. Standard statuses
    - **Draft** if the decision is newly proposed and in active discussion
    - **Provisional** if the decision is still preliminary and in experimental phase
    - **Accepted** *(date)* once it is agreed upon
    - **Superseded** *(date)* with a reference to its replacement if a later ADR changes or reverses the decision

    If an ADR has Draft status and the PR is under review, you can either use the intended final status (e.g. Provisional, Accepted, etc.), or you can clarify both the current and intended status using something like the following: "Draft (=> Provisional)". Either of these options is especially useful if the merged status is not intended to be Accepted.

Context
-------

TODO: Add context of what led to the creation of this repo.

.. This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.

Decision
--------

We will create a repository...

TODO: Clearly state how the context above led to the creation of this repo.

.. This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. "We will â€¦"

Consequences
------------

TODO: Add what other things will change as a result of creating this repo.

.. This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.
