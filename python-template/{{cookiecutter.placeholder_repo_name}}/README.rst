{{ cookiecutter.project_short_description}}

The ``README.rst`` file should start with a brief description of the repository,
which sets it in the context of other repositories under the ``edx``
organization. It should make clear where this fits in to the overall edX
codebase.

Overview (please modify)
------------------------

The ``README.rst`` file should then provide an overview of the code in this
repository, including the main components and useful entry points for starting
to understand the code in more detail.

Documentation
